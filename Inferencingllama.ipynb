       "AIMessage(content=\"DeepSeek is an AI research project that aims to develop a knowledge graph-based model for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The reasoning capabilities of DeepSeek are based on its ability to process and integrate information from multiple sources, making connections between different concepts and entities.\\n\\nHere's how DeepSeek develops reasoning capabilities:\\n\\n1. **Knowledge Graph Representation**: DeepSeek represents knowledge as a graph of entities, relationships, and attributes. This graph is used to store and retrieve information, allowing the model to make inferences and draw conclusions based on the available data.\\n2. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)**: DeepSeek uses GNNs to process the graph structure and extract relevant information. GNNs are designed to propagate information through the graph, allowing the model to reason about complex relationships between entities.\\n3. **Attention Mechanisms**: DeepSeek employs attention mechanisms to focus on specific parts of the graph when making predictions or inferences. This allows the model to selectively weigh the importance of different pieces of information and avoid over-reliance on irrelevant data.\\n4. **Graph-based Reasoning**: DeepSeek's reasoning capabilities are based on the manipulation of the knowledge graph itself. The model can add, remove, or modify entities, relationships, and attributes in the graph, allowing it to reason about the consequences of different actions or events.\\n5. **Hybrid Architecture**: DeepSeek's architecture combines traditional neural network components with graph-based models, enabling the incorporation of both sequential and graph-based reasoning mechanisms.\\n\\nBy integrating these components, DeepSeek is able to develop its reasoning capabilities through:\\n\\n1. **Entity Disambiguation**: The model can disambiguate entities with the same name but different meanings, allowing it to reason about their relationships and attributes.\\n2. **Conceptual Entailment**: DeepSeek can make inferences based on the relationships between concepts, enabling it to understand implications and consequences.\\n3. **Inferential Reasoning**: The model can use graph-based reasoning mechanisms to infer missing information or connections between entities.\\n4. **Common Sense Knowledge**: DeepSeek incorporates common sense knowledge into its reasoning capabilities, allowing it to reason about everyday situations and events.\\n\\nOverall, DeepSeek's reasoning capabilities are based on its ability to process and integrate information from multiple sources, making connections between different concepts and entities, and using graph-based models to manipulate the knowledge graph itself.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'llama3.2', 'created_at': '2025-05-12T15:29:00.6622506Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 60569946200, 'load_duration': 2432003200, 'prompt_eval_count': 33, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1466609800, 'eval_count': 479, 'eval_duration': 56594133700, 'model_name': 'llama3.2'}, id='run--35436932-b70e-40d7-979c-a487a92dd930-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 33, 'output_tokens': 479, 'total_tokens': 512})"

It’s important to understand how quickly we\\nwere able to come to agreement, which reflects that perhaps the differences were not\\nso large as maybe thought. That being said, there was a lot of groundwork that went into\\nthese two days.
